Platform Part

 

Physical Design
o   Hardware Layout. 
Get more info on the location of the VMs on the vcenter side - getting overall network from VMs to outside endpoints 


o   Product life Cycle.
- version 3.71 - and the support life cycle 

o   Capacity and Performance.
sizing info

o   Physical topology (Physical Connectivity Diagram, Locations and namings, interface assignments if any).
- name of switches if possible
 

Logical Design
o   Traffic flows.
- network flow from ACS to outsiode endpoints 
- managing ACS 
- Internal connectivty between ACS component  - done 

o   IP/VLAN Assignments. - done 

o   Logical topology diagrams. - done 

 

High Availability
o   Local Redundancy + failure scenarios. - done - ocp depencdny - explain how OCP handle pods availability 


o   Geo Redundancy (if applicable) + failure Scenarios. - not applicatble 


 

Management Plane Design
o   Management connectivity.
- how to manage ACS , and to access the centrl ...etc 
load balancer IP 

o   Management traffic flows.
- integration point trrafic 
- email
- jira 
- Pipeline Jenkins 

o   VLAN and IP assignments.
- Load balancer IPs to access ACS 


explaining the function and the privilage of the central admin user 
explaining assigning different roles to different users 





Integration Points (Pipeline, SIEM, Registries, . . )
- registry inetgration 
- pipeline 
- jira
- email 






Identity and Access Management
Operational aspects:
Fault/Alarm/Performance Management.
- prometheous console to view ACS namespace 

System Logging.
- OCP logging integration points on the ACS namespace level 

Backup/Restore.
- backup for ACS configuration ? export secuirty policies is there 
- backup integration points 
- share with ElKoush the contact of Haitham to backup namespaces 



Any other Operations Acceptance Requirements.
- define acceptance list of ACS 



Policy Part

configuration samples for the below if applicatable 
deafult and example
